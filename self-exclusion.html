        <p>
          If you feel you are at risk of developing a gambling problem or
          believe you currently have a gambling problem, please consider using
          Self-Exclusion which prevents you gambling with betexch247 for a
          specified period of 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years or permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to stop playing for other reasons, please consider a
          Time-Out or using Account Closure.
        </p>
        <h3>What happens when you self-exclude?</h3>
        <p>
          During a period of Self-Exclusion you will not be able to use your
          account for betting, although you will still be able to login and
          withdraw any remaining balance. It will not be possible to re-open
          your account for any reason, and betexch247 will do all it can to
          detect and close any new accounts you may open.
        </p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>
          Whilst we will remove you from our marketing databases, we also
          suggest that you remove betexch247 from your notifications and
          delete/uninstall all betexch247 apps, downloads and social media
          links. You may also wish to consider installing software that blocks
          access to gambling websites, click here for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend that you seek support from a problem gambling support
          service to help you deal with your problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can self-exclude your account in the My Gambling Controls section
          of Members by choosing Self-Exclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively you can contact our customer care team for assistance
          and further information.
        </p>
        <h3>Self-Exclusion Notice</h3>
        <p>
          Should you opt to self-exclude from betexch247, we strongly
          recommend that you seek exclusion from all other gambling operators
          you have an account with.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can self-exclude by contacting other gambling operators directly
          or you can exclude from other licensed operators by completing a
          Self-Exclusion Notice form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once completed the Self-Exclusion Notice form should be submitted to
          the nominated site, sports bookmaker or betting exchange operator.
